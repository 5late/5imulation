# 5imulation

**Made to settle a friendly discussion - How fast could the planet repopulate?**

## Rules

- The simulation stops at 1 000 000 people
- At age 18 people start breeding
- People constantly breed unless:
    - They are under 18
    - They already have a baby on the way
- Every 80 years 0.56% of the population dies (similar to death toll every 80 years)
- The first 18 years are empty
- Chances of twins/triplets can be edited
